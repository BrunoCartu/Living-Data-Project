Some brief instructions on how to collaborate on GitHub
(for Windows using Bash)


JOINING AN EXISTING PROJECT
- get invited as a collaborator
- click on CODE (green) button and copy link
- make a new folder on your local machine
- open GitBash, type:
git clone https://.....
- this clones the folder from GitHub into the folder you just made
- navigate to shared folder (inside the folder you made) (I did this by closing Bash, and reopening it at the inside folder)
- check if folder is connected to correct github destination:
git remote -v


CHANGING FILES AND PUSHING TO GITHUB (to MASTER)
- after making changes, add them to git
git add . (adds everything)
git add test.txt (only adds test.txt)
git commit -m "..."
git push


CREATING A NEW BRANCH
This is quite useful for branching: https://gist.github.com/blackfalcon/8428401
- to see what branch you are on, type
git branch (there will be a * beside the branch you are on)
- go to a different branch:
git checkout branchname
- make a new branch:
git checkout -b my-new-branch
- pull to new branch:
git pull origin master (or potentially just git pull)
- now, all changes will be on this branch, which can later be merged with the master branch
- push branch to github
git push origin my-new-branch
